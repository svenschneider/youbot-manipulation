		 * The IK solver. It solves for translation (x, y, z) as well as roll
		 * and pitch of the final arm pose. A pose with yaw != 0 cannot be
		 * solved, so it's not possible to provide the yaw.
		 *
		 * The "offset" parameters allow searching for redundant solutions.
		 * Joint 1 can either be pointing towards the position or away from the
		 * position. Joint 3 can either be up or down.
		 *
		 * The IK solver is based on a geometric approach:
		 * - Joint 1 determines the "pointing" direction of the arm. It can be
		 *   considered in isolation by only looking at the x-y-plane. This
		 *   enables us to treat the remaining joints in a plane that is
		 *   perpendicular to the x-y-plane.
		 * - Joint 2 and joint 3 determine the height and distance of the
		 *   gripper (seen in the frame of joint 2). They have to be considered
		 *   in combination, which also leads to a redundant solution.
		 *   The height and distance of the gripper depend on the pitch of the
		 *   final.
		 * - Joint 4 determines at which pitch angle the final pose is
		 *   approached.
		 * - Joint 5 determines at which roll angle the final pose is
		 *   approached. It can be considered in isolation. There are two
		 *   possible solutions: One is the provided roll and the other is the
		 *   provided roll plus pi.
		 *
		 *
		 * @param x: X coordinate of the cartesian position
		 * @param y: Y coordinate of the cartesian position
		 * @param z: Z coordinate of the cartesian position
		 * @param roll: Roll of the gripper
		 * @param pitch: Pitch of the gripper
		 * @param offset_joint_1: Determines the result of the first joint
		 * @param offset_joint_3: Determines the result of the third joint
		 * @param offset_joint_5: Determines the result of the fifth joint
		 * @return: If there is a solution a JntArray with five entries is
		 * 			returned, else the JntArray is empty.
